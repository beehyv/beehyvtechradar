AWS  EC2,aws,adopt,FALSE,"Elastic Cloud Compute(EC2) is part of AWS compute services and provides Secure and resizeable compute capacity
(virtual servers) in the cloud. AWS EC2 was among the initial cloud offerings from AWS and we also  have also been using it to deploy various applications since its inception. "
Azure Virtual Machines,azure,adopt,FALSE,Virtual Machines provides infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and can be used in different ways. VMs are an ideal choice when we  need total control over an operating system and environment. We have used Azure Virtual machines while deploying applications in Azure ecosystem
Google Compute Engine,gcp,adopt,FALSE,On-demand instances in the cloud can be used to run many applications instead of maintaining servers on-premise. We have used GCP compute while deploying applications  in GCP ecosystem
AWS ECS,aws,adopt,FALSE,"Cloud providers provide highly secure, reliable, and scalable way
to run containers.  AWS provides ECS and EKS to run contairized applications. Though EKS is based on cloud agnostic Kubernetes and has orchestration, ECS could be cost-effective when there are lesser containers. Based on the requirements, we have leveraged AWS ECS to run containers built across OS and programming languages.We would leverage Container instances when we need to run containers in cloud based on the application and its scale.
"
Azure Container Instances,azure,trial,FALSE,"Cloud providers provide highly secure, reliable, and scalable services
to run containers. Azure provides Container Instances and Azure Kubernetes service to run containers.  Container instances provide a fast and simple way to run containers when there is no added benefit with orchestration service. Though we haven't run production applications in Azure Container instances,  We would leverage Container instances when we need to run containers in cloud based on the application and its scale."
